          content: `
          <p>During my time as a computer science student, my best “in-class” computing experience was building a Twitch drop miner. This project challenged me to apply my programming skills to interact with web APIs, manage automation, and optimize performance. Not only did I get to work with real world data and solve practical problems, but I also learned a lot about debugging, efficiency, and the importance of user experience. Seeing my code in action successfully collecting Twitch drops was incredibly satisfying and boosted me as a developer.</p>
          <p>Outside the classroom, my best computing experience has come from working on personal projects for my startup company, Nano Software Services LLC. Building software solutions from the ground up, managing product development, and seeing ideas turn into real applications for clients has been both challenging and rewarding. These personal projects have allowed me to experiment, learn new technologies, and develop my entrepreneurial skills. There’s nothing quite like the excitement of seeing your own software make a difference in the real world.</p>

          <p> In class, we discussed different approaches to personal ethics, including Utilitarianism, 
          Deontological, and relativism. Personally, 
          I believe ethics is about balancing good intentions with good outcomes following core principles while considering the impact of my actions on others.
          Everyone's perspective is valuable, and I think reflecting on these differences helps us grow. </p>

          content: `
           <p>
              Watching the documentary <strong>Citizenfour</strong> was both eye-opening and unsettling. 
              The film revealed the extent of government surveillance, which often overreaches and infringes upon our basic human right to privacy. 
              What stood out to me was seeing Edward Snowden not just as an abstract figure in the news, but as a real person wrestling with the consequences of his actions.
               This made the documentary more personal and relatable, allowing viewers to empathize with his fears and the moral dilemmas he faced in challenging such overwhelming power.
                The disconnect between the public's understanding of privacy and the actual capabilities of government agencies was truly alarming.
                 The sheer scale of these surveillance programs was shocking, 
                 and the documentary effectively showed how easily the boundaries of privacy and civil liberties can be crossed in the name of security—often without public awareness or consent.
