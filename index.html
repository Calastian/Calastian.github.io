        <h2>ASL (American Sign Language) To Text Translator</h2>
        <span class="company">Developed a Transformer Model to translate ASL gestures into English text using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and C++</span>
        <p class="summary-text">The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of translating American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into written English text in real time. 
          This solution aims to bridge the communication gap between Deaf/hard-of-hearing individuals and non-ASL speakers, providing accessibility and inclusivity in various contexts.
          While many resources exist for text or speech-based communication, there is a significant lack of real-time, automated tools for ASL users to convert their signed gestures into text.
          Existing solutions often require expensive hardware or are not robust enough for diverse environments.
          Our objective is to build an accessible, accurate, and user-friendly ASL-To-Text model using commodity hardware (e.g., webcams or mobile phone cameras).</p>

            <p> 
              As this semester comes to a close, I've had some time to reflect on everything I've learned. One thing I discovered is that it's important to study consistently as you go. Waiting to review everything right before an exam is not the best approach—regular repetition and review are truly worthwhile!

              I often felt hesitant to ask for help or work with classmates at first, but participating in study groups and class discussions made a huge difference. The key takeaway is to never pass up an opportunity to improve yourself with others' help.

              Last but not least, privacy in today's age is both fleeting and important. Do your best to keep your digital footprint small.

              And finally, some advice for anyone reading this blog: start strong, stay consistent, and finish strong. The workload may feel overwhelming at times, but if you keep up from the beginning and don't hesitate to ask for help, you'll set yourself up for success.

            <p> 
              I want to explore the topic Biometric Surveillance what this is a automated collection and/or processing of biological or behavioral identifiers to detect, identify, track, or infer information about people. Includes live, continuous, or retrospective recognition in public or private spaces.
              Biometric systems pose unique privacy risks. Unlike passwords, biometric traits can’t be changed if exposed, and widespread deployment enables continuous tracking and profiling. Data often get repurposed, stored centrally, and linked with other records creating powerful surveillance profiles. Biases and errors make harms worse for marginalized groups, and the mere presence of cameras chills public life. Because these risks are structural, technical fixes alone aren’t enough 
              I want to explore this topic in the case of what is right or wrong or in what cases is it ethical or does this go against our privacy rights!

                On Privacy I think it really matters our digital imprint on the internet and theres a lot out there about everyone and it is a little scary to see and be able to track someones whole life
                just by the simple things that are publically posted online. I feel like and I want a little more security on the internet of what people can and cannot see. Even though its technically impossible 
                to remove things that have been posted or put online it is something I would like to be able to have as a right.

           <p>
              Watching the documentary <strong>Citizenfour</strong> was both eye-opening and unsettling. 
              The film revealed the extent of government surveillance, which often overreaches and infringes upon our basic human right to privacy. 
              What stood out to me was seeing Edward Snowden not just as an abstract figure in the news, but as a real person wrestling with the consequences of his actions.
               This made the documentary more personal and relatable, allowing viewers to empathize with his fears and the moral dilemmas he faced in challenging such overwhelming power.
                The disconnect between the public's understanding of privacy and the actual capabilities of government agencies was truly alarming.
                 The sheer scale of these surveillance programs was shocking, 
                 and the documentary effectively showed how easily the boundaries of privacy and civil liberties can be crossed in the name of security—often without public awareness or consent.

          <p> Somethings I have learned about Hive Tracks and Bee Informed Partnership's ethics case study: On Data Privacy/Ownership and Polices.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Clear policies on data ownership and the distribution of intellectual property rights are essential for both nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Establishing transparent guidelines ensures fair collaboration, protects contributors, and supports ethical business practices.</p></li>
            <li><p>Comprehensive beekeeping data plays a vital role in supporting bee health and sustainability. Platforms like Hive Tracks enable effective data collection and analysis, empowering beekeepers and researchers to make informed decisions that benefit both bees and the broader ecosystem.</p></li>
            <li><p>Initially, I assumed beekeepers might be concerned about their hive locations being accessible to other beekeepers, but in reality, this is not a significant issue for them.</p></li>

          <p> In class, we discussed different approaches to personal ethics, including Utilitarianism, 
          Deontological, and relativism. Personally, 
          I believe ethics is about balancing good intentions with good outcomes following core principles while considering the impact of my actions on others.

          <p>During my time as a computer science student, my best “in-class” computing experience was building a Twitch drop miner. This project challenged me to apply my programming skills to interact with web APIs, manage automation, and optimize performance. Not only did I get to work with real world data and solve practical problems, but I also learned a lot about debugging, efficiency, and the importance of user experience. Seeing my code in action successfully collecting Twitch drops was incredibly satisfying and boosted me as a developer.</p>
          <p>Outside the classroom, my best computing experience has come from working on personal projects for my startup company, Nano Software Services LLC. Building software solutions from the ground up, managing product development, and seeing ideas turn into real applications for clients has been both challenging and rewarding. These personal projects have allowed me to experiment, learn new technologies, and develop my entrepreneurial skills. There’s nothing quite like the excitement of seeing your own software make a difference in the real world.</p>
